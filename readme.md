FAQ
===

### Why does this exist?
AeroSnap doesn't work for all use cases. In particular it fails for monitors in portrait mode. AeroSnap produces two ultra-skinny 540x1920 windows side-by-side; the preferred layout is two 1920x540 windows stacked vertically.

fts_winsnap is user-configurable per-monitor so windows can snap to arbitrary rectangles. Portrait mode and ultrawide monitors rejoice!
